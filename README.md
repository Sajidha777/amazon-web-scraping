Web scraping amazon using Python Beautiful Soup
Given a URL of a product search in amazon.in, the code extracts the details of each product in the search result page and writes to a csv file.
The details extracted are product title, price, brand, rating, total number of ratings and the ingredients(if given).(the url I've used is the search result page for 'sunscreen')
